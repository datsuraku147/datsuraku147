# Guni-guni ng isang gamu gamo :D

I’m 20 and I'm a wannabe security researcher.

## Hobbies:

 - Listening to Music (every day!!!)
 - Making Music in my room (sometimes)
 - Watching Movies/Series/TVShow (or anything fun)
 - Reading (RIP comick.io)

## Life Goals: 

* I just want a small house, small farm, small garden, and a small studio with a bunch of Instrumentssssssss (dreaming of a light blue or light green electric guitar)

**Current Goal: Improve Quality of Life**
